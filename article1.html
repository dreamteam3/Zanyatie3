    <h1>Discredited gene-editing researcher vows to
        clear his name</h1>
        <p>

            A Chinese biologist whose team on Wednesday retracted a high-profile paper on a <br>
              gene-editing technology has vowed to press ahead with experiments that he hopes will <br> 
              vindicate the potential rival to the CRISPR/Cas9 system. <br>
              In May 2016, Chunyu Han of Hebei University of Science and Technology in Shijiazhuang, <br>
              China, and colleagues published a paper in Nature Biotechnology describing a gene-editing <br>
             system using an enzyme, Argonaute nuclease, from the organism Natronobacterium gregoryi(NgAgo). <br>
              The technology was hailed on social media as Nobel Prize–worthy work and Han, the paper’s lead <br>
             author, rose to fame in China. He was elected vice president of Hebei Association for Science <br>
             and Technology and conferred the <br>
              title of “most beautiful teacher in Hebei.” That August, Hebei government officials approv <br>
             ed a plan to establish a $32 million gene-editing research center at the university. The fate of <br>
             the center is unclear; Chinese journalists who visited Hebei University of Science and Technology <br>
              reportedly could not locate the center, and staff said they were unaware of it. <br>
             Han’s star began to fall late last year, when independent labs in China, South Korea, <br>
              Germany, and the United States began reporting their failures to replicate the paper’s key <br>
              result. In a 3 August statement, Han’s team acknowledged that “so far there is no second paper <br>
             showing NgAgo-gDNA can be used for gene-editing.” Last January, a patent on the NgAgo technology <br>
              that Han and a colleague applied for in 2015 was effectively withdrawn after the duo failed to respond <br>
             inquiries from China’s State Intellectual Property Office, the office’s online database shows. <br>

        </p>
                 <p>Han’s team continues to stand by their findings, stating that “when key requirements are met, <br>
                  the NgAgo-gDNA system can effectively edits genes.” They did not reveal what the “key requirements” <br>
                   are. And they are pressing for another attempt to independently verify that the NgAgo system works. <br>
                    “Our next step, in response to social concerns, is to do the relevant work in accordance with the school <br>
                     arrangements, to select a third party laboratory, accompanied by peer experts to carry out experiments to <br>
                      verify the efficiency of NgAgo-gDNA gene-editing technology and publish the results,” they stated. Han <br>
                       could not be reached for comment. <br>
                 “They feel like the NgAgo technology is still possible. But I think the possibility is minimal,” says Bo Tang, <br>
                  a molecular biologist at China Agricultural University in Beijing who uses CRISPR/Cas9 technology in his research. <br>
                   “Now [Han] is on thin ice,” he says.
