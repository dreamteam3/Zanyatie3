    <h1>Meet the college dropout who invented the
        gravitational wave detector
    </h1>
    <p>By Adrian ChoAug. 4, 2016 , 9:00 AM</p>
    <p>Nearly 50 years ago, Rainer Weiss dreamed up a way to
        detect <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/topic/gravitational-waves">gravitational waves</a>—infinitesimal ripples in spacetime
        predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. Last
        September, that dream came true as 1000 physicists working with
        the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO),
        two huge detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford,
        Washington, sensed a pulse of waves radiated by two massive
        black holes as they spiraled into each other a billion light-years
        away. The discovery makes Weiss, a physicist at the
        Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, a sure
        bet to win a Nobel Prize, his peers say. Weiss, 83, acknowledges
        the prospect with some apprehension. “It will fuck me up for a
        year,” he predicts as he nimbly steers his silver Volkswagen Beetle
        ragtop through Cambridge traffic. “That’s what it did to John
        Mather.” The line is vintage “Rai,” his friends will tell you: blunt,
        irreverent, funny, and impatient with anything that gets in the way
        of his work.

            Weiss is also known for speaking his mind. “He is absolutely 100%
            committed to honesty both in his physics and in life,” says Peter
            Saulson, a LIGO physicist at Syracuse University in New York, who
            worked with Weiss at MIT in the 1980s. Dirk Muehlner, a retired
            physicist in Alamo, California, and one of Weiss’s early graduate
            students, shares that sentiment. “He’s totally honest. There’s no
            bullshitting for Rai. There’s no performance.”

            As a teenager, Weiss developed two passions: classical music and
            electronics. Snapping up army surplus parts, he repaired radios out
            of his bedroom. He even made a deal with the local toughs: If they
            left him alone as he lugged radios to and from the subway, he’d fix
            theirs for free. “They would steal things and I would have to fix
            them,” he says. “It wasn’t a good deal.”

            Weiss’s sister, playwright Sybille Pearson, confirms that Weiss
            spent as much time as possible out of the unhappy home. But, as
            the only son, he was still something of a prince in his family, she
            says. For example, whenever the family moved to a new
            apartment, Weiss got the biggest bedroom to himself, she recalls.
            In the late 1960s that connection remained tenuous, however.
            Radiation from the big bang should have a “thermal spectrum” with
            a lopsided peak indicating the radiation’s temperature. At long
            wavelengths, several groups had observed a climbing spectrum
            consistent with a temperature of 3°C above absolute zero. But in
            1968, rocket measurements found high amounts of shorter
            wavelength radiation that clashed with a thermal spectrum and
            threatened the big bang hypothesis.

            To probe the matter, Weiss and his graduate student Muehlner built
            a device that would fly on a weather balloon and measure the
            microwave spectrum to shorter wavelengths. In 1973, after three
            flights and a rebuild, they had solid data that fit a thermal spectrum
            and for the first time revealed the telltale peak. “It completely
            destroyed the rocket result,” Burke says. “Among those interested
            in the microwave background, [Weiss] was suddenly one of their
            stars.”

            that the CMB has a thermal spectrum. It also sensed tiny 1-partin-
            100,000 variations in the CMB’s temperature from point to point
            on the sky—traces of infinitesimal quantum fluctuations in the
            newborn universe that are essential to the standard model of
            cosmology. In 2006, Americans John Mather and George Smoot
            shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for, respectively, measuring the
            spectrum and detecting the fluctuations.

            Weiss realized that output could reveal a passing gravitational
            wave, which generally would stretch the arms by different amounts.
            He let the class chew on the idea in homework and wrote a 23-
            page report in the quarterly newsletter of MIT’s Research
            Laboratory of Electronics. LIGO sprouted from that document.

            Weiss insists the concept of an interferometric detector was
            already “floating around.” But others say he was the first to spell
            out that the detector would have to be kilometers long and to
            describe how to deal with the various types of noise—from seismic
            vibrations to the pinging of individual photons on the mirrors—that
            could drown out the elusive waves.

            In the meantime, Weiss became a fixture in Building 20, identifiable
            by the corncob pipes he smoked until he suffered a mild heart
            attack in 1995. He would work until 2 a.m., says <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2012/06/gravitationa">Nergis Mavalvala,
            a LIGO physicist at MIT</a> who was Weiss’s graduate student from
            1990 to 1997, and would stay even later to help a student. When
            Mavalvala failed her qualifying exams, Weiss had her attend
            “reform school” in his office every Saturday for weeks. “He didn’t
            give a damn about the exams,” Mavalvala says. “But he knew that I
            had to get past them.”

            Weiss earned a reputation for lending nontraditional students a
            helping hand. In 1983, Lyman Page, who had been out of school
            for 5 years and had spent 2 years sailing around the world, walked
            into Weiss’s lab and asked whether he could work for him. “He said
            ‘I can’t pay you, but you can work in the lab,’” Page says. “So I
            worked as a carpenter during the day and in the lab at night.”
            Page, now a cosmologist at Princ eton, credits Weiss for giving him
            a chance that others did not.
